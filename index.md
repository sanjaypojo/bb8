## Abstract

> Humans can rapidly perceive their environment to make judgements about the goals and actions of others around them. In fact, developmental studies show that infants as young as six months are able to infer goals or desires based on people’s “reaching” motion [10]. However, building computational models for these sophisticated cognitive abilities continues to be a challenge. As robots move from the assembly line to becoming collaborators with people in a range of domains, it is necessary to consider models for robot behavior that are intuitive from the perspective of a human observer or collaborator [5]. In this review, we aim to explore research in brain and cognitive science, human-robot interaction, and artificial intelligence in order to understand how human beings predict the motion goals of others, with a specific focus on we can apply these learnings to better models for action parsing and goal inference in robot behavior for human-robot collaboration.
